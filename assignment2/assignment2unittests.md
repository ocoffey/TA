# Possible cases

Split into two halves; testing that the linked list/nodes work properly, and test that using it with a parser/files works properly

## Testing Linked List

*

## Testing with Files

* Test that they can parse correctly
* Test that they can make an event loop
* Test that all of their commands work (baseline)
* For search, test that they account for 's' without anything after (check that they print something to let user know)
* for numberic input, see if they account for negatives, see if they account for larger numbers (far larger than number nodes)
*
